<div class="blurb">
	<p>Cashewhub.com is a global buying and selling club for cashew products such as Raw Cashew Nuts in Shell, Processed Cashew Kernels, Flavoured Cashew Kernels, Cashew Shell Oil, Cardanol, Residol, and other by-products. It works as a service oriented b2b facilitator between cashew producers and consumers.</p>
	<p> There are more than 25000+ raw cashew farmers / exporters, cashew processors / factories, wholesellers / retailers worldwide, and all these are more or less dependent upon local brokers thus <em>operating in an unorganized market</em>.</p>
	<p>
		We have started cashewhub.com with a single vision to organize the selling and buying of the cashew produce as we fear cashew industry might decline by 70% to 80% by 2025 under current market conditions. We help consumers (buyers) source cashew produce from verified pool of producers (sellers) registered on our platform. After receiving buying requirements from consumer, we engage with producers to supply requested cashew produce, and possess appropriate certifications. From this pool of qualified producers, we start a bidding process, which we then share with consumer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our mission is to help farmers and factories sell their cashew produce directly to consumer at market value prices so to keep them and other associated bodies motivated to cultivate, harvest and process the crop. We are looking for industry watchers and advisors to join our board to save cashew industry from declining. Please <a href="mailto:contact@cashewhub.com">drop</a> us an email to show interest.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most of the people, who have not worked with us yet, might think of cashewhub as a brokerage service but tell you upfront we are totally against your hiring brokers to buy and sell as they are the ones who benefit from your miseries. We are just a B2B <a href="http://www.cashewhub.com/#services">services</a> company, which stands by you in your miseries considering them as our own, working on a small percentage or fixed fee.
	</p>
  <p>P.S. Also from today, 9th Nov 2016, the old 500 and 1000 rupee notes in India are not legal tender. This is the undoubtedly best step taken by Modi ji's Govt to beat black money problems. And yeah, keep everything, around you, clean. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan!</p>
