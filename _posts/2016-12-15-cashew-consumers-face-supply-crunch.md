  <p>“Prices are going through the roof,” says Ian Dyas, who handles cashews at London-based nut traders CG Hacking. Excessive heat and lack of rain linked to the El Niño weather phenomenon earlier this year affected cashew producers in Africa and Asia, while a rise in labour costs in India as well as an import tax has led to numerous processing plants being idled.</p>

  <p>Cashew prices have jumped a fifth from the start of the year to about $4.20 a pound, with buyers facing a tight market for the rest of the year. Michael Stevens, a trader at Freeworld Trading in Edinburgh, says: “The rest of this year will be very tricky.” The high prices are likely to worry cashew buyers, including retailers and food processors who use the treenut in a range of foods including biscuits, cereals and sauces such as pesto, say traders.</p>
  <p>Vietnam and India are the two largest producers and exporters of cashew kernels. The two countries process raw nuts that they produce as well as importing raw material from Africa, including Ivory Coast, Tanzania and Benin, and re-exporting the processed product. Production for 2016 could fall about 4 per cent to 708,000 tonnes, according to early estimates by the International Nut and Dried Fruit Council.</p>
  <p>The delays and poor yields meant that packers in Vietnam, who had overcommitted their sales, were forced to delay shipments. This in turn caused a shortage on the European market, further pushing up prices. While some buyers sought to wait out the rally for further raw nut from Africa to Vietnam and India, the quality and supply volumes have failed to improve, forcing them to scramble in a thin market.</p>

  <p>The tight supply situation has been aggravated by the troubles facing India’s cashew processors. A rise in labour costs ate into profit margins, leading to facilities being idled, while a new import tax on raw cashew nuts has also crippled the sector, leading to lower export flows from the country.</p>

  <p>However, high prices weighed on demand, while forecasts of a good crop this year also depressed the market. Almonds are now the cheapest tree nut, priced between $2.25 and $3 a pound depending on the grade, compared with cashews, pecans, Brazil nuts, walnuts and pistachios which are all above $3.50.</p>
