  <p>
    Cashew industry's dependency and reliance on brokers is one of the primary reasons of cashew industry still being unorganized especially in India and Africa. <br /><br />
    The founder of Cashewhub.com himself has been trading Raw Cashew Nuts for more than 12+ years and has been involved in cashew processing since 2013. Cashewhub.com is the answer to challenges faced by him to operate in an unorganized industry. <br /><br />
    After being fed up with calling the brokers and fed up with waiting for them for weeks to inspect processed cashew stock for sale he took the stepping stone and started this platform where the only mission is to organize cashew industry by unified marketplace, automated technology implementation, digitization, knowledge based processes implementation etc.

    Cashewhub.com is the once in a while opportunity to jump on it and save cashew industry from declining. Let us take this pledge today and jump on the bandwagon. <br /><br />
