    Global Cashew Industry is worth approx 12 Billion USD but it still operates in an unorganized structure because of its dependency on brokers. And, this dependency is at each level of the transactional chain i.e. business is done through them; from selling of RCN to factory by farmer/exporter, from selling of cashew kernel & other by-products to trader by factory, and then again from selling of cashew products to retailer by trader. Yup, you're right they still make money at the end of the day - whether we as farmers, exporters, factories, traders, retailers make money or not - because they have nothing on stake.

    So far there was no such platform available exclusively for cashew industry where businesses can sell and buy cashew products at an exceptionally low fee than what brokers charge. Thus we have started cashewhub.com with a single vision to organize selling and buying of cashew produce as we fear cashew industry might decline by 70% to 80% by 2025 under current market conditions. At cashewhub.com we provide our customers a single window, to all services required to supply cashew produce from farmer to ultimate consumer, to do business which will ultimately organize the cashew industry and save it from declining.
